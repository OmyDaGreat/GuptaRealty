                    I help buyers, and sellers navigate the OC real estate market with confidence — and I’ve been licensed since January 2022.
                    Originally from India, I’ve called OC home for the past 20 years and have lived in Anaheim since then.

                    I’m known for being personable, organized, and honest — but also a strong advocate when it matters most.
                    Outside of real estate, I’m a big traveler. When I’m not working, you can usually find me playing board games with my kids or finding a new coffee shop somewhere.
